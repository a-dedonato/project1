This is a website for the Kellogg Improv Club, which I'll be one of the co-presidents of next year. We don't have much of a need for a seperate website, but I still though it'd be fun to think about the type of content we'd put on it.

The Improv Club host a few events, but it's major output is putting on improv classes that are taught by local improvisers.

The website consists of a few pages: a homepage, that links to the class overview page; a class overview page, which explains the different classes we offer; a class signup page, which allows students to provide their information and availability for classes (as we learn about SQL and back end development, I would imagine that that this page would could be flexible to account for the different times that different classes are offered and to take payments over stripe); and some pages with additional content such as some basic FAQs, the people who are in leadership positions, and those who have graduated through the program.
